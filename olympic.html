    <h3>Olympics History</h3>
    <p>
        Athletes prayed to Zeus for victory and left gifts to thank him for their successes.
        Worshipping Zeus was one of the few things the ancient Greeks agreed on.
        Divided into different city-states, or settlements, the Greeks were often at war with each other.
        But even in times of unrest, dueling city-states declared a truce so their athletes could take part in the Olympics.
         Many events, including sprinting and wrestling, are still part of the modern games.
        Other sports such as chariot racing are history. 
        Here’s another one that’s long forgotten: Called the pankration, the event was known as the ultimate fighting sport. 
        Milon of Croton was a wrestler who won six Olympic championships.
        The ancient Games continued until the Roman emperor Theodosius I stopped them in 393 ce.
        For the next 1,500 years there were no Olympics. In the late 1800s a Frenchman named Pierre de Coubertin worked to revive them.
        He introduced the motto of the modern Olympics: Citius, altius, fortius which means “Faster, higher, stronger.”
        The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, Greece. 
    </p>
    <h2>A few facts about the Olympics</h2>
    <p>
        The Games were named for their location at Olympia, a sacred site located near the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece.
        Their influence was so great that ancient historians began to measure time by the four-year increments in between Olympic Games, 
        which were known as Olympiads. Did you know? The 1896 Games featured the first Olympic marathon,
        which followed the 25-mile route run by the Greek soldier who brought news of a victory over the Persians from Marathon to Athens in 490 B.C.
        Fittingly, Greece's Spyridon Louis won the first gold medal in the event. In 1924, the distance would be standardized to 26 miles and 385 yards.
